    <string name="aboutLongText">This app was developed to run in the background
    and serve as a reminder to maintain proper posture.
        \n \n
        The regular notification option uses Android\'s native alarm scheduler to only send
     reminders after a specified interval. \n \n
        The Smart Alert option uses the device\'s accelerometer to determine
     the angle relative to the floor. It preserves battery life by only polling the
        sensor momentarily every minute and only when the screen on.
     \n\nA device position between 0 and 35 degrees most
    often leads to a non-neutral neck position. In that instance, you will receive a Smart Alert.\n\n
